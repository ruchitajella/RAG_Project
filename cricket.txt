Cricket is not just a game played on a field of green,
It is a story told in silence, in cheers, in spaces unseen.
It begins with the morning sun touching the pitch,
Where hope takes guard and destiny waits at the crease.

A bat rests on the shoulder, heavy with dreams,
Carved from hours of practice and quiet schemes.
A bowler marks his run-up, breath held tight,
Each step a question, each delivery a fight.

The ball leaves the hand with a whisper of fate,
Spinning, swinging, refusing to wait.
It cuts through the air like a thought half-spoken,
Testing technique, patience, and nerves unbroken.

The batsman watches, the world standing still,
Eyes locked in battle against pace and skill.
A forward press, a perfect line,
Or a mistimed shot that falls to time.

The sound of leather meeting willow sings,
A clean straight drive where confidence springs.
Crowds rise as one, hearts beating fast,
Moments like these are built to last.

Cricket is patience measured in overs long,
Where defense can be brave and restraint is strong.
It teaches that waiting is part of the art,
And not every victory comes from the start.

In Tests it breathes slowly, deep and wise,
Five days to reveal who truly survives.
Sweat and dust, cracked pitch and sun,
A battle of minds until the match is won.

In ODIs it learns to balance the scale,
Between caution and courage, success and fail.
Run rates climb, equations change,
Every over feels strange.

In T20 it dances, fearless and bold,
A firework story quickly told.
Sixes rain, records fall,
One moment decides it all.

The fielders move like pieces in play,
Saving a run, turning the day.
A diving stop, a throw on the bounce,
A single run denied can make hope pounce.

Wicketkeepers crouch with silent grace,
Eyes sharp, gloves ready, guarding the space.
A stumping in a blink, a catch behind,
Proof that focus is a disciplined mind.

Umpires stand calm amid the noise,
Balancing pressure with careful poise.
A raised finger, a nod, a shake of the head,
One signal and history is said.

Cricket is joy in a village lane,
With a taped tennis ball and improvised chain.
Stumps of bricks, bats of wood,
Rules rewritten as children understood.

It lives in radio voices, crackling and clear,
In late-night matches watched with fear.
In parents explaining cover drive form,
In tea breaks taken during a storm.

It is heartbreak too, sharp and real,
A dropped catch, a loss hard to heal.
Tears in the dressing room, silence loud,
Dreams delayed, not disallowed.

Legends rise from sweat and scars,
Not just from talent but from hours and hours.
They fall, they return, they learn to stand,
Leaving footprints across the land.

Cricket teaches life without speaking loud,
That winning is earned, not simply allowed.
That teamwork matters, ego must bend,
And every innings has an end.

When the match is over and the ground is empty,
Echoes remain of battles plenty.
The pitch remembers every run,
Every story written under the sun.

So cricket lives beyond bat and ball,
Beyond trophies, beyond the call.
It lives in hearts, in memory, in time,
A slow-burning, beautiful rhyme.
